# Character-Generator

A program that randomly generates adjectives and 3 colours for a character design exercise. The user must provide the number of adjectives they would like to describe their character.

NOTE: The list of adjectives is a heavily edited version of the list found here: https://www.d.umn.edu/~rave0029/research/adjectives1.txt
